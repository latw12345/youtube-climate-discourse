# Climate Change Narratives on YouTube: Discourse and Geography

## Topic and Search Parameters

This project examines how climate change is discussed on YouTube by comparing both language framing and geographic context. I collected video metadata using automated web scraping of YouTube search results.

The following two main dimensions of comparison were used:

### Framing-Based Searches

To examine how climate change discourse varies by rhetorical framing, three distinct groups of search terms were defined and used consistently across data collection. Each group was designed to capture a different narrative orientation commonly observed in public climate discussions.

#### Neutral framing
Neutral terms were selected to capture general, descriptive, or informational discussion of climate change without implying urgency or skepticism:

- climate change  
- climate science  
- carbon emissions  

#### Alarmist framing
Alarmist terms were chosen to emphasize urgency, crisis, and severe consequences, reflecting narratives that frame climate change as an immediate and escalating threat:

- climate crisis  
- climate emergency  
- climate catastrophe  

#### Dismissive framing
Dismissive terms were selected to capture skeptical or denial-oriented narratives that question the legitimacy, severity, or motivations behind climate change discourse:

- climate change hoax  
- global warming hoax  
- climate change scam

### Location-Based Searches

To compare how climate change discourse differs across places with varying levels of climate exposure, two geographically distinct groups of U.S. cities were defined. These groups were based on commonly cited climate vulnerability factors such as extreme heat, flooding, drought, and sea-level rise.

#### High-risk locations
These cities were selected because they are frequently identified as having higher exposure to climate-related risks, either due to geography, climate trends, or urban vulnerability:

- New Orleans, LA (29.9511, -90.0715)  
- Virginia Beach, VA (36.8529, -75.9780)  
- Baltimore, MD (39.2904, -76.6122)  
- San Jose, CA (37.3382, -121.8863)  
- Riverside, CA (33.9806, -117.3755)  
- Phoenix, AZ (33.4484, -112.0740)

#### Lower-risk locations
These cities were selected as locations with comparatively lower immediate climate exposure within the scope of this exercise, particularly in terms of extreme heat and coastal flooding:

- Akron, OH (41.0814, -81.5190)  
- Cleveland, OH (41.4993, -81.6944)  
- Columbus, OH (39.9612, -82.9988)  
- Dayton, OH (39.7589, -84.1916)  
- Toledo, OH (41.6528, -83.5379)  
- Pittsburgh, PA (40.4406, -79.9959)  
- Grand Rapids, MI (42.9634, -85.6681)

#### Search query construction
For each city listed above, the same set of location-specific climate queries was used to ensure consistency across locations and to focus the results on locally relevant content. The following query patterns were applied (with `{city}` replaced by the full city name):

1. climate change `{city}`  
2. climate impacts `{city}`  
3. extreme weather `{city}`  

## Motivation for the Comparison

I chose this topic because climate change is an issue that is discussed in many different ways, depending on both the language used and the real-world conditions people experience. The same underlying scientific topic can be framed as an urgent crisis, a neutral scientific process, or something that is questioned or dismissed. By selecting three distinct framing categories, alarmist, neutral, and dismissive, this project is designed to capture how different word choices reflect different interpretations, priorities, and attitudes toward climate change. These terms were chosen to represent common ways the issue is described in public discourse, allowing the analysis to compare how emphasis on urgency, neutrality, or skepticism shapes the language that appears in climate-related content.

In addition, I included a location-based comparison to examine whether local environmental conditions are associated with differences in how climate change is discussed. Cities identified as higher-risk were selected because they are more frequently linked to extreme heat, flooding, drought, or sea-level rise, while lower-risk cities were chosen to represent areas where these impacts may be less immediately visible in daily life. This design allows the project to explore whether communities facing more direct climate-related challenges tend to use more concrete, impact-focused language, and whether areas with lower immediate exposure show different patterns in emphasis or framing. Together, these choices help isolate how both terminology and geographic context may influence the way climate change is discussed.
